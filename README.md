# detecting-outlier-measurements-and-trajectories-in-longitudinal-children-growth-data

**Background**: Growth studies rely on longitudinal measurements, typically represented as
 trajectories. However, anthropometry is prone to errors that can generate outliers. While various
 methods are available for detecting outlier measurements, a gold-standard has not been identified
 and there is no established method for outlying trajectories. Thus, outlier types and their effects
 on growth pattern detection remain under-investigated. This work aimed to assess the
 performance of six methods at detecting different types of outliers, propose two novel methods
for outlier trajectory detection, and evaluate how outliers affect growth pattern detection.
**Methods**: We included 393 healthy infants from The Applied Research Group for Kids
 (TARGet Kids!) cohort and 1651 children with severe malnutrition from the co-trimoxazole
 prophylaxis clinical trial. We injected outliers of three types and six intensities, applied four
 outlier detection methods for measurements (model-based and World Health Organization cut49 offs-based) 
 and two for trajectories. We also assessed growth pattern detection before and after
 outlier injection using time series clustering and latent class mixed models. Error type, intensity,
 and population affected method performance. 
 **Results**: Model-based outlier detection methods
 performed the best for measurements with precision between 5.72-99.89%, especially for low
 error intensities and moderate errors. The clustering-based outlier trajectory method had high
 precision 14.93-99.12%. Combining methods improved detection rate up to 21.82% in outlier
 measurements. Finally, when comparing growth groups with and without outliers, the outliers
 were shown to alter group membership by 57.9 -79.04%. 
 **Conclusions**: World Health Organization cut-offs-based techniques were shown to perform well on few, very particular cases
(extreme errors of high intensity), while model-based techniques performed well, especially for
  moderate errors of low intensity. Clustering-based outlier trajectory detection performed
 exceptionally well across all types and intensities of errors, indicating a potential strategic
change in how outliers in growth data are viewed. Finally, the importance of detecting outliers
 was shown given its impact on children growth studies, as shown by comparing results of growth
 group detection.
